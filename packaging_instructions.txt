# Packaging Instructions for Chrome Web Store

Follow these steps to prepare the JIRA Ticket Copier extension for submission:

1. **Run All Checks and Build**
   - Lint and format code:
     ```sh
     npm run lint
     npm run format
     ```
   - Run all unit tests:
     ```sh
     npm test
     ```
   - Validate the manifest:
     ```sh
     npm run validate-manifest
     ```
   - Build the extension:
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```
   - Bump version and update changelog:
     ```sh
     npm run release
     ```
   - Review the extension in Chrome locally for UI/UX and functionality.

2. **Package for Chrome Web Store (Final Step)**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run package
     ```
   - This creates `jira-ticket-copier.zip` with only the required files:
     - `manifest.json`
     - `dist/` (contains `content.js` and `icons/`)
     - `README.md` (optional)
     - `packaging_instructions.txt` (optional)

3. **Submit to Chrome Web Store**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
   - Upload the ZIP file.
   - Fill out extension details, upload icons, and provide screenshots.
   - Submit for review.

4. **After Submission**
   - Record reviewer feedback and any required changes in `instruction.txt`.
   - Note any bugs or user suggestions from initial usage.
   - Plan next improvements and update documentation as needed.

# Notes
- Make sure all code is well-documented and matches the latest requirements.
- Update `instruction.txt` with packaging results and next steps after submission.
- Always run all checks and review the extension before packaging and release.
