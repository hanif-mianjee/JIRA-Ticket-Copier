# Packaging Instructions for Chrome Web Store

Follow these steps to prepare the JIRA Ticket Copier extension for submission:

1. **Build the Extension**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```
   - This generates all distributable files in `dist/` (including JS and icons).

2. **Clean Up Files**
   - Ensure only required files are included:
     - `manifest.json`
     - `dist/` (contains content.js and icons)
     - `README.md` (optional for reviewers)
     - `packaging_instructions.txt`

3. **Create ZIP Archive**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     zip -r jira-ticket-copier.zip manifest.json dist/ README.md packaging_instructions.txt
     ```
   - Ensure the ZIP contains no `node_modules`, `.venv`, or test files.

4. **Submit to Chrome Web Store**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
   - Upload the ZIP file.
   - Fill out extension details, upload icons, and provide screenshots.
   - Submit for review.

5. **After Submission**
   - Record reviewer feedback and any required changes in `instruction.txt`.
   - Note any bugs or user suggestions from initial usage.
   - Plan next improvements and update documentation as needed.

# Notes
- Make sure all code is well-documented and matches the latest requirements.
- Update `instruction.txt` with packaging results and next steps after submission.
