# Packaging Instructions for Chrome Web Store

Follow these steps to prepare the JIRA Ticket Copier extension for submission:

1. **Verify Functionality**
   - Test the extension in Chrome on multiple JIRA ticket pages.
   - Confirm the button appears, copies ticket info, and handles errors/accessibility as expected.

2. **Clean Up Files**
   - Remove or exclude test files (`src/utils.test.js`).
   - Ensure only required files are included:
     - `manifest.json`
     - `src/content.js`
     - `src/background.js`
     - `src/utils.js`
     - `src/icons/icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
     - `README.md` (optional for reviewers)

3. **Create ZIP Archive**
   - Select all required files and folders.
   - Right-click and choose "Compress" or use the command:
     ```sh
     zip -r jira-ticket-copier.zip manifest.json src/ README.md
     ```
   - Ensure the ZIP contains no node_modules, .venv, or test files.

4. **Submit to Chrome Web Store**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
   - Upload the ZIP file.
   - Fill out extension details, upload icons, and provide screenshots.
   - Submit for review.

# Notes
- Make sure all code is well-documented and matches the latest requirements.
- Update `instruction.txt` with packaging results and next steps after submission.
