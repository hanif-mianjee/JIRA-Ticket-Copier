# üîß Plan for the Extension
We are building a Chrome extension that integrates with JIRA web pages. It should:
1. Detect when a user is on a JIRA ticket page.
2. Extract the ticket ID, title, and status from the DOM.
3. Provide a simple UI element (e.g., button or context menu) to copy that data to clipboard in the following format:
   AB-1234: In Progress - Sample ticket title here
4. Package and prepare the extension for Chrome Web Store submission.

# üìã Requirements
- Works with JIRA cloud interface (URL pattern: https://*.atlassian.net/browse/*)
- Button appears intuitively on the JIRA ticket page
- Clicking the button copies a string formatted like: AB-1234: In Progress - Sample title
- Must use clean JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and manifest v3
- Styling should blend with JIRA UI
- Modular, well-documented code
- Include unit tests for utility functions (e.g., DOM extraction, format generation)
- Provide a dev/test environment setup guide
- Prepare ZIP for Chrome Web Store upload

# ‚úÖ Current State of Development

## Progress as of July 17, 2025
## Unit Test Results (July 17, 2025)
## UX & Documentation Improvements (July 17, 2025)
## Branding Update (July 17, 2025)

- Replaced previous icons with a universally recognizable clipboard/ticket design in 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG formats using macOS Preview.
- Manifest and packaging instructions now reference the new icons.
- Button now includes ARIA attributes and tabindex for accessibility.
- Improved error handling: button shows error if ticket info is missing or copy fails.
- Button placement refined: appears after ticket ID for better UX.
- All main functions in content.js are now documented with JSDoc comments for maintainability.
All utility function tests passed:
- `formatJiraString` formats correctly
- `extractJiraTicketInfo` returns empty strings if elements not found
- `extractJiraTicketInfo` extracts info from DOM

Jest configured with Babel for ES module syntax. Test environment: jsdom.
- Project initialized with manifest v3 and modular file structure:
  - `manifest.json` (extension config)
  - `src/content.js` (injects button, handles copy)
  - `src/background.js` (service worker, placeholder)
  - `src/utils.js` (DOM extraction, formatting)
  - `src/utils.test.js` (unit tests for utils)
  - `src/icons/` (icon folder, add icons before packaging)
  - `README.md` (setup, dev/test, packaging guide)
- DOM selectors for JIRA cloud interface identified and used for ticket ID, status, and title extraction.
- Button is injected into JIRA ticket header, styled to blend with JIRA UI, and copies formatted string to clipboard.
- MutationObserver ensures button persists on SPA navigation.
- Unit tests for utility functions created (Jest, jsdom).
- Markdown and code linting errors resolved.

## Post-Submission (TODO)

After submitting to the Chrome Web Store:
- Record reviewer feedback and any required changes.
- Note any bugs or user suggestions from initial usage.
- Plan next improvements (e.g., context menu support, more robust DOM extraction, options page, localization).
- Update this file with feedback and a new TODO list for the next agent/developer.

## What‚Äôs Next (TODO)

1. Test extension in Chrome on multiple JIRA ticket pages for robustness.
2. Refine UI/UX (e.g., accessibility, error handling, button placement).
3. Add more documentation/comments to code if needed.
4. Follow packaging_instructions.txt to prepare ZIP for Chrome Web Store (exclude test files, include icons).
5. ZIP archive `jira-ticket-copier.zip` cleaned: all unnecessary files (`.DS_Store`, `src/utils.test.js`) removed. Ready for Chrome Web Store submission.
6. Update this file with test results and packaging steps after submission.
7. After submission, document feedback and next steps for future improvements or bug fixes.

# üîÅ Reusable Prompt for AI Agent Continuation
You are continuing the development of a Chrome extension based on the plan in this file. Your tasks are:
1. Read all instructions and understand the current state.
2. Build the required components based on priority.
3. After completing a step, update the "Current State of Development" section with details.
4. Always document new files, code functions, and design decisions.
5. Ensure all required features are working and tested.
6. If you finish a major milestone, repackage the extension and update instructions for the next milestone.
7. You may use your own judgment and creativity to improve UX or code quality if the results remain aligned with the goals.
8. After each round of work, append a new section in this file titled "What‚Äôs Next" with a TODO list for the next agent/developer.
