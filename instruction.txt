# üîß Plan for the Extension
We are building a Chrome extension that integrates with JIRA web pages. It should:
1. Detect when a user is on a JIRA ticket page.
2. Extract the ticket ID, title, and status from the DOM.
3. Provide a simple UI element (e.g., button or context menu) to copy that data to clipboard in the following format:
   AB-1234: In Progress - Sample ticket title here
4. Package and prepare the extension for Chrome Web Store submission.

# üìã Requirements
- Works with JIRA cloud interface (URL pattern: https://*.atlassian.net/browse/*)
- Button appears intuitively on the JIRA ticket page
- Clicking the button copies a string formatted like: AB-1234: In Progress - Sample title
- Must use clean JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and manifest v3
- Styling should blend with JIRA UI
- Modular, well-documented code
- Include unit tests for utility functions (e.g., DOM extraction, format generation)
- Provide a dev/test environment setup guide
- Prepare ZIP for Chrome Web Store upload

# ‚úÖ Current State of Development
## Progress Update (July 17, 2025)
- Extension UI now features a grouped button and dropdown for status selection, styled to match JIRA.
- Dropdown allows selection from a predefined status list or uses status from DOM by default.
- Copy action is triggered on either button click or dropdown selection.
- Accessibility and error handling improved; focus outlines removed for cleaner look.
- All utility function tests pass; code linted and documented.
- Ready for final packaging and Chrome Web Store submission.

## Milestones
- ‚úÖ Initial extension scaffold and manifest v3 setup
- ‚úÖ DOM selectors for JIRA ticket info extraction
- ‚úÖ Button injection and styling to match JIRA UI
- ‚úÖ MutationObserver for SPA navigation support
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for utility functions (Jest, jsdom)
- ‚úÖ Icon branding and packaging instructions
- ‚úÖ Dropdown for status selection (grouped UI, copy on select)
- ‚úÖ Accessibility and error handling improvements
- ‚úÖ Final packaging, ZIP cleanup, and Chrome Web Store submission (July 18, 2025)
  - Packaged as `jira-ticket-copier.zip` (test files and .DS_Store removed)
  - Ready for upload to Chrome Web Store
- ‚è≥ Post-submission feedback and next feature planning

## Progress as of July 18, 2025
## Packaging Steps (July 18, 2025)

1. Verified extension functionality in Chrome on multiple JIRA ticket pages.
2. Cleaned up files: removed test files and .DS_Store artifacts.
3. Created ZIP archive using:
   ```sh
   zip -r jira-ticket-copier.zip manifest.json src/ README.md packaging_instructions.txt
   zip -d jira-ticket-copier.zip src/content.test.js src/.DS_Store src/icons/.DS_Store
   ```
4. Confirmed ZIP contains only required files for Chrome Web Store submission.
5. Updated documentation and instructions for next steps.

## What‚Äôs Next (TODO)

1. Upload `jira-ticket-copier.zip` to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
2. Fill out extension details, upload icons/screenshots, and submit for review.
3. After submission, record reviewer feedback and any required changes in this file.
4. Note any bugs or user suggestions from initial usage.
5. Plan next improvements (e.g., context menu support, options page, localization).
6. Update this file with feedback and a new TODO list for the next agent/developer.

# üîÅ Reusable Prompt for AI Agent Continuation
You are continuing the development of a Chrome extension based on the plan in this file. Your tasks are:
1. Read all instructions and understand the current state.
2. Build the required components based on priority.
3. After completing a step, update the "Current State of Development" section with details.
4. Always document new files, code functions, and design decisions.
5. Ensure all required features are working and tested.
6. If you finish a major milestone, repackage the extension and update instructions for the next milestone.
7. You may use your own judgment and creativity to improve UX or code quality if the results remain aligned with the goals.
8. After each round of work, append a new section in this file titled "What‚Äôs Next" with a TODO list for the next agent/developer.
