## Project overview

A Chrome extension to quickly copy JIRA ticket info (ID, status, title) to your clipboard from any JIRA Cloud ticket page. The extension injects a button styled to match the JIRA UI, with a dropdown for status selection and robust accessibility.

## Requirements

We have created very awesome extension and it is helping alot to boost productivity. I have received so many positive reviewes. Now at this time, we need to get serious about our extension as it is becoming popular and we might be adding so many new features.

Lets work on the options page UI. Currently our options page (`src/options/options.html`) does not look professional. The font size is not good. colors are not good. boxes does not look good. spacing is not good.

Check the sample options page: `sample_options_page.html` # this is not professional UI, do not bench mark this. Just check how preview is done. Always use your own experience.

Please come up with your creative ideas and design very professional page that people love and thank you. Think harder. Research on how to create best UI/UX.

Display the preview when ever there is format input.

Do not display the current version or github link.

**MAKE SURE THE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY DOES NOT BREAK. EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK PERFECTLY AFTER THE CHANGES**
